# 🌟 Fiza Amjad's Gitfolio

## 👩‍💻 About Me
Hi! I'm Fiza, a Computer Science student at UET Lahore and currently interning at Techinoid. I’m passionate about full-stack web development, data-driven applications, and building software that makes life easier. I enjoy solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and working on projects that bring real-world impact.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

I'm primarily working with the **MERN stack**:
- **MongoDB** – Document database for flexible data storage
- **Express.js** – Backend framework for building APIs
- **React.js** – Frontend library for building responsive UIs
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for scalable backend services

Other tools I use:
- **Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, ShadCN** – For modern, responsive UIs
- **Figma** – For design and prototyping
- **PostgreSQL, Power BI, TensorFlow** – When the project demands specialized tools

## 🧠 Fun Fact
I love playing video games — especially ones that involve strategy or storytelling. When I’m not coding, I unwind by painting or sketching on canvas. I believe creativity in art spills beautifully into writing clean, expressive code. 🎮🖌️💻
